h1. rah_change_passwords

p. A "Textpattern":http://textpattern.com plugin adds options to "Users":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=Users panel that allow freely changing any user's password and resetting login sessions. The main difference to Textpattern built in password resetting feature is that you as a "Publisher":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=User_Roles_and_Permissions can change any user's passwords to anything you want. As such, users do not need to receive emails containing any automatically generated passwords or do password restoring themselves.

h2. Requirements

p. Minimum requirements:

* Textpattern 4.5.0 or newer.

h2. Installing

p. Rah_change_passwords' installation follows the standard plugin installation steps.

# Download the plugin installation code.

# Run the automated setup.
# After the setup is done, activate the plugin. Done.

h2. Usage

p. Rah_change_password will add extra options to the "Users":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=Users panel's editor. When logged in with a "Publisher":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=User_Roles_and_Permissions account, you will see options to change the password when editing any user account. These added extra options include a way to reset login sessions, to change and optionally email passwords.
